# Zig Vulkan Tutorial

A repo to track my work on making a more concentrated effort in learning Vulkan with Zig (and GLFW and Mach).


#### Setup

* Install whatever Mach's currently [nominated version](https://machengine.org/about/nominated-zig/) of Zig happens to be.
* Install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/).
* Run it!
```
zig build run
```
